# How to use

Using DSM Pro is easy! Just copy the loadstring below and execute!

Script:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/P-DennyGamingYT/DSM-Pro/main/DSM.lua"))()
```

INF Credits/XP: To use, I recommend just clicking the EXP button 6 times and then rebirthing until you hit max rank, after that you can give yourself as much money as you want as when you rebirth your money and stats get reset!
